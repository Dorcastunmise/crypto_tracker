## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure & Important Notes
Frontend: React app bootstrapped with Vite for fast builds.

Context API: Uses React‚Äôs Context to manage crypto data globally.

API Source: Crypto data is fetched from CoinGecko API (free, public API for crypto prices and market data).

Backend:
This project currently does not include a backend server, as it relies on the public CoinGecko API.
However, for production or advanced use, you may want to create a Node.js backend using Express.js to:

Cache API results to reduce API calls.

Secure API keys if you switch to a private crypto API.

Add user authentication or custom features.
